    <h1>Caramelised Onions</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Soft, richly flavoured caramelised onions are a wonderful accompaniment to cold meats, pates and terrines, 
       and make a great base for savoury tarts. They're very easy to make at home - you simply cook the onions slowly to caramelise their natural sugars, while the brown sugar and balsamic help the process along.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White onions</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat about 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-low heat.</li> 
        <li>Once hot, add the onions and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Add sugar ater 15-20 minutes of cooking.</li>
        <li>Keep stirring every 5-10 minutes, until deeply caramelized, about 1 Â½ - 2 hours.</li> 
        <li>If the onions start to burn at any point, lower the heat slightly and add a splash of water to deglaze any bits stuck to the pan.</li> 
        <li>Season with salt and set aside to cool completely. </li>
    </ol>
